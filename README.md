# AI Adaptive Diagnostic Engine

This project implements a **1‑Dimensional Adaptive Testing System** based on **Item Response Theory (IRT)**. The system dynamically selects questions based on a student's estimated ability and produces an **AI‑generated personalized study plan** after the diagnostic test.

The goal is to simulate the core mechanics used in modern adaptive exams such as:

* GRE
* GMAT
* Duolingo English Test

# Adaptive Testing Algorithm

The system uses a **2‑Parameter Item Response Theory (IRT) model**.

Probability that a student answers a question correctly:

```
P(correct) = 1 / (1 + e^( -a(θ - b) ))
```

Where

| Symbol | Meaning                 |
| ------ | ----------------------- |
| θ      | Student ability         |
| b      | Question difficulty     |
| a      | Question discrimination |

---

# Adaptive Workflow

1. Student begins with **initial ability θ = 0.5**.

2. The system selects a question that **maximizes Fisher Information** near the student's current ability.

3. After the student answers the question, ability is updated using an online update rule:

```
θ_new = θ + learning_rate * (r - P(correct))
```

Where

```
r = 1 if answer is correct
r = 0 if answer is incorrect
```

4. Updated ability is stored in the session.

5. The system selects the next question using the updated ability estimate.

6. The test continues for **10 adaptive questions**.

7. After the test finishes:

* Weak topics are identified
* Performance score is computed
* Gemini generates a personalized study plan

---

# Question Selection Strategy

Questions are selected using **Fisher Information maximization**.

```
I(θ) = a² * P(θ) * (1 − P(θ))
```

Questions with the highest information value near the student's ability are prioritized.

Additional safeguards:

* Difficulty selection window of **±0.15** around current ability
* Small randomness added to prevent identical question sequences

---

# Performance Score

The system computes an overall performance metric using:

```
Performance Score =
0.5 * Final Ability
+ 0.3 * Accuracy
+ 0.2 * Average Difficulty of Correct Answers
```

This score prevents late correct answers from artificially inflating ability.
